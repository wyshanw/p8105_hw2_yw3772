Clean the Mr.trash wheel dataset by omit non-data & note entries, omit
non-dumpster-specific rows, give reasonable names, and round sports
balls to integer

``` r
# import mr.trash dataset and omit note entries
mr_trashwheel_df <- 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2021-sept.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
             range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  # omit non-data entries
  select(-Month) %>% 
  # omit non-dumpster-specific rows
  drop_na() %>% 
  # give reasonable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # round sports balls
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

Import the 2018 & 2019 precipitation dataset

``` r
# import 2018 precipitation dataset and omit note entries and NA entries
precipitation_2018 <-
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2021-sept.xlsx", 
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14")  

# import 2019 precipitation dataset and omit note entries and NA entries
precipitation_2019 <-
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2021-sept.xlsx", 
             sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14")  
```

Combine two dataframe, add a new variable “year”, and convert month
number to character

``` r
# create function to convert month number to character
my.month.name <- Vectorize(function(n) c("January", "February", "March", 
                                         "April", "May", "June", "July", 
                                         "August", "September", "October",
                                         "November", "December")[n])

precipitation_df <- 
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019) %>% 
  mutate("year" = c(rep(2018, 12), rep(2019,12) ),
         Month = my.month.name(Month)) %>% 
  relocate(year) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

**Descriptions of the above datasets**

There are 344 observations in Mr.trashwheel dataset. Variable “dumpster”
is denoted by numbers range from 1 to 344. Variable “date” is coded as
year-month-day. For example, 2014-05-16. All other variables are coded
as numbers.

There are 18 observations in combined 2018 & 2019 precipitation dataset.
Variable “year” consists of 2018 and 2019. Variable “month” consists of
all twelve month in character The total precipitation, denoted by
variable “total”, range from 0.16 to 10.47

Total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33.

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.
